/** \file
 *
 * Support for running Halide compiled JavaScript and/or WASM code in-process.
 * Bindings for parameters, extern calls, etc. are established and the
 * JavaScript/WASM code is executed. Allows calls to relaize to work
 * exactly as if native code had been run, but via a JavaScript VM. This is
 * largely used to run all JIT tests with the JavaScript backend, but
 * could have other uses in the future. Currently, V8 is supported, with
 * SpiderMonkey intended to be included soon as well.
